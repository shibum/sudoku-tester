# sudoku tester coding challenge

The goal of this challenge is to implement a function, that checks whether the given input is valid sudoku or not.

This application is developed with PHP and MVC framework.  Entire code architecture is built from the scratch.  However this application does not use Modals as it does not connects to any databases.


## Way of working

It's prettry simple. Fork the repository and run it with webserver that supports PHP7.  Make sure you have rewrite modules enabled in your http_config or php.ini


## DEMO

You can find the working demo here which is hosted in Heroku

There are no limitations about the implementation, also there are doors to improve in the frontend which I haven't concentrated much here.

Thank you!
